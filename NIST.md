## NIST RMF

https://csrc.nist.gov/projects/risk-management/about-rmf

The NIST Risk Management Framework (RMF) and the NIST Special Publications (SP) 800-53, 800-53A, and 800-53B are interconnected, providing a comprehensive approach to managing security and privacy risks in federal information systems.

Essential activities to prepare the organization to manage security and privacy risks 
Categorize the system and information processed, stored, and transmitted based on an impact analysis
Select the set of NIST SP 800-53 controls to protect the system based on risk assessment(s)
Implement the controls and document how controls are deployed
Assess to determine if the controls are in place, operating as intended, and producing the desired results
Senior official makes a risk-based decision to authorize the system (to operate)
Continuously monitor control implementation and risks to the system
